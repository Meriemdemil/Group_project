 Points in this Chapter 
 • Show several real - life problems , which can be converted to 
 problems on graphs . 
 • Give algorithms to solve several common graph problems . 
 • Show how the proper choice of data structures can 
 drastically reduce the running time of these algorithms . 
 Basic Definitions 
 • A graph G = ( V , E ) consists of a set of vertices , V , and a set of 
 edges , E. 
 • Each edge is a pair ( v , w ) , where v , w ∈ V. 
 Edges are sometimes 
 referred to as arcs . 
 • If the pair is ordered , then the graph is directed . 
 Directed graphs 
 are sometimes referred to as digraphs . 
 • Vertex w is adjacent to v if and only if ( v , w ) ∈ E. 
 • 
 In an undirected graph with edge ( v , w ) , and hence ( w , v ) , w is 
 adjacent to v and v is adjacent to w. 
 •

 Basic Definitions 
 If the graph contains an edge ( v , v ) from a vertex to itself , then the 
 path v , v is sometimes referred to as a loop . 
 ( The graphs we will 
 consider will generally be loopless . ) 
 • for undirected graphs , the edges must be distinct . 
 ( Note that the 
 path u , v , u in an undirected graph should not be considered a 
 cycle , because ( u , v ) and ( v , u ) are the same edge . ) 
 • In a directed graph , these are different edges , so it makes sense to 
 call this a cycle . 
 • A directed graph is acyclic if it has no cycles . 
 An undirected graph is connected if there is a path from every 
 vertex to every other vertex . 
 A directed graph with this 
 property is called strongly connected . 
 • Weakly connected graph : a directed graph not strongly 
 connected , but the underlying graph ( without direction to the 
 arcs ) is connected . 
 i.e. it is possible to reach any node starting 
 from any other node by traversing edges in some direction 
 ( i.e. , not necessarily in the direction they point ) . 
 • Complete graph : a graph in which there is an edge between 
 every pair of vertices . 
 Practical Examples of Graphs 
 Airport system : 
 • The edge could have a weight , representing the time , distance , or cost of the flight . 
 • Such a graph is ( logically ) directed , since it might take longer or cost more to fly in 
 different directions . 
 • Ideally , the airport system is strongly connected , so that it is always possible to fly 
 from any airport to any other airport . 
 Traffic flow : 
 Each street intersection represents a vertex , and each street is an edge . 
 • The edge costs could represent a speed limit , a capacity ( number of lanes ) , etc . 
 • We could ask for the shortest route or find the most likely location for bottlenecks . 
 Representation of Graphs 
 • A simple way to represent a graph is to use a two - dimensional array known as an 
 adjacency matrix representation . 
 • For each edge ( u , v ) , set A[u][v ] to true ; otherwise to false . 
 • If the edge has a weight associated with it , then one can set A[u][v ] to the weight and use 
 either a very large or a very small weight as a sentinel to indicate nonexistent edges . 
 • Example , if we were looking for the cheapest airplane route , we could represent 
 nonexistent flights with a cost of ∞. For the most expensive airplane route , we could use 
 −∞ to represent nonexistent edges . 
 • 
 Adjacency matrix representation : 
 • Advantage : extreme simplicity 
 • Disadvantage : the space requirement is Θ(|V|2 ) which can be prohibitive if the graph 
 does not have very many edges . 
 • 
 An adjacency matrix is an appropriate representation if the graph is dense : |E| = Θ(|V|2 ) . 
 • In most applications , not true . 
 E.g. : a graph representing a street map . 
 Alternative Graph Representation 
 • If the graph is sparse ( i.e. not dense ) , a better solution is an adjacency list 
 representation . 
 It is the standard way to represent graphs . 
 • For each vertex , we keep a list of all adjacent vertices . 
 • The space requirement is then O(|E| + |V| ) , which is linear in the size of the 
 graph . 
 • If the edges have weights , then this additional information is also stored in 
 the adjacency lists . 
 • A common requirement in graph algorithms is to find all vertices adjacent to 
 some given vertex v. 
 This can be done , in time proportional to the number of 
 such vertices found , by a simple scan down the appropriate adjacency list .

 Adjacency List Representation of a Graph 
 10 
 Maintaining the Adjacency Lists 
 • Several alternatives : the lists can be maintained in either vectors or lists . 
 • 
 For sparse graphs , when using vectors , initialize each vector with a smaller 
 capacity than the default to avoid wasted space . 
 11 
 Topological Sort 
 • 
 A topological sort is an ordering of 
 vertices in a directed acyclic graph , 
 such that if there is a path from vi to 
 vj , then vj appears after vi in the 
 ordering . 
 • A directed edge ( v , w ) indicates that 
 course v must be completed before 
 course w may be attempted . 
 • A topological ordering of these 
 courses 
 is any course sequence that 
 does not violate the prerequisite 
 requirement . 
 The ordering is not necessarily unique ; any legal ordering 
 will do . 
 Find any vertex with no incoming edges . 
 Apply this same strategy to the rest of the graph . 
 • Let us define the indegree of a vertex v as the number of 
 edges ( u , v ) . 
 • We compute the indegrees of all vertices in the graph . 
 The indegree is computed for every 
 vertex . 
 The topological ordering then is the 
 order in which the vertices dequeue . 
 Topological sort algorithm 
 14 
 Complexity of the Topological Sort Algorithm 
 • Time complexity of this algorithm is O(|E| + |V| ) if adjacency lists are used . 
 • 
 Indeed , the body of the for loop is executed at most once per edge . 
 • Computing the indegrees can be done with the code below ; the same logic shows 
 that the cost of this computation is O(|E| + |V| ) 
 for each Vertex v 
 v.indegree = 0 ; 
 for each Vertex v 
 for each Vertex w adjacent to v 
 w.indegree++ ; 
 • The queue operations are done at most once per vertex . 
 • 
 The other initialization steps , including the computation of indegrees , also take 
 time proportional to the size of the graph . 
 • We now assume that the input is a weighted 
 graph : Associated with each edge ( v , v ) is a 
 i j 
 cost c to traverse the edge . 
 i , j 
 • The weighted path length is the cost 
 𝑁−1 
 σ 𝐶 of a path v v . . . 
 𝑖=1 𝑖,𝑖+1 1 2 N 
 • The unweighted path length is the number of 
 edges on the path , i.e. N − 1 . 
 • Single - Source Shortest - Path Problem : 
 Shortest - Paths & negative - cost cycles 
 • 
 This can cause problems … 
 • Note that we could stay in the loop arbitrarily long . 
 • Same applies to the shortest path from v1 to v6 : 
 undefined , as we can get into the same loop . 
 • This loop is known as a negative - cost cycle ; when 
 one is present , the shortest paths are not defined . 
 Example of Applications 
 Networks : 
 • Modeling airplane ( or other mass 
 • Vertices represent computers ; transit ) routes by graphs . 
 an edge represents a link 
 ( phone bill per a megabyte of 
 • 
 Currently there are no algorithms in 
 other computers . 
 18 
 Unweighted Shortest Paths 
 • Given some vertex , s , find the shortest path 
 from s to all other vertices of an unweighted 
 graph . 
 • For now , suppose we are interested only in the 
 length of the shortest paths , not in the actual 
 paths themselves . 
 ( Easy to keep track of the 
 actual paths . ) 
 • If s is chosen as v3 . 
 • We mark this information on the graph . 
 These can be found by looking 
 at the vertices that are adjacent to s. 
 • 
 • Finally , examine the vertices adjacent to the 
 recently evaluated v2 and v4 . 
 • All vertices have now been calculated , 
 20 
 Unweighted Shortest Paths 
 Dijkstra ’s Algorithm 
 • 
 If the graph is weighted , the problem ( apparently ) becomes harder , but we 
 can still use the ideas from the unweighted case . 
 • 
 Each vertex is still marked as either known or unknown , distance dv is kept 
 for each vertex , as well as pv , the last vertex to cause a change to dv . 
 Dijkstra ’s algorithm : the general method to solve the single - source 
 shortest - path problem . 
 It is an example of a greedy algorithm . 
 • Greedy algorithms generally solve a problem in stages by doing what 
 appears to be the best thing at each stage . 
 But do not guarantee to always 
 get the best solution . 
 • In Dijkstra ’s algorithm , with the 
 same logic , set dw = dv + 𝐶 if 
 𝑣,𝑤 
 this new value for dw would be an 
 improvement . 
 • i.e. the algorithm decides if it is a 
 good idea or not to use v on the 
 path to w. 
 • 
 The cost calculated above is the 
 cheapest path using v ( and only 
 known vertices ) . 
 Dijkstra ’s Algorithm 
 • Assume that the start node , s , is v1 . 
 It is marked known . 
 • Now that v1 is known , some entries need 
 to be adjusted . 
 The vertices adjacent to 
 v1 are v2 and v4 . 
 We continue like this … .

 Stages of Dijkstra ’s algorithm 
 27 
 Pseudocode for Dijkstra ’s algorithm 
 • Vertex class for Dijkstra ’s algorithm ( pseudocode ) and printPath 
 • Pseudocode for Dijkstra ’s algorithm 
 28 
 Analysis of ’s algorithm 
 • A proof by contradiction will show that the algorithm always works as long 
 as no edge has a negative cost . 
 ( If any edge has a negative cost , the 
 algorithm could produce the wrong answer ) . 
 • The running time depends on how the vertices are manipulated . 
 • If the vertices are scanned sequentially to find the minimum dv , each phase 
 will take O(|V| ) time to find the minimum dv vertex , and thus the algorithm 
 will take O(|V|2 ) time for finding the minimum . 
 • The time for updating dw is constant per update , and there is at most one 
 update per edge for a total of O(|E| ) . 
 • Thus , the total running time is O(|E|+|V|2 ) = O(|V|2 ) . 
 • If the graph is dense , with |E| = ( |V|2 ) , this algorithm is not only simple but 
 also essentially optimal , since it runs in time linear in the number of edges . 
 Analysis of ’s algorithm 
 • If the graph is sparse , with |E| = ( |V| ) , the algorithm is too slow . 
 • The distances would thus need to be kept in a priority queue . 
 Selection of the vertex v is a deleteMin operation , since once the unknown 
 minimum vertex is found , it is no longer unknown and must be removed from 
 future consideration . 
 a. Treat the update as a decreaseKey operation . 
 b. Insert w and the new value d into the priority queue every time w ’s 
 w 
 distance changes . 
 ( See the textbook for the details ) 
 Both yield a O(|E| log |V| ) time complexity to the algorithm . 
  it is important in many applications to use a priority queue to solve 
 this problem . 
 • 
 There are better time bounds possible using Dijkstra ’s algorithm if 
 different data structures are used . 
 Graphs with Negative Edge Costs 
 • If the graph has negative edge costs , then Dijkstra ’s algorithm does not work . 
 • The problem : once a vertex , u , is declared known , it is possible that from 
 some other unknown vertex , v , there is a path back to u that is very negative 
 such that taking a path from s to v back to u is better than going from s to u 
 without using v. 
 A working solution , but with a drastic increase in running time , is a 
 combination of the weighted and unweighted algorithms : 
 • No use of the concept of known vertices 
 • Begin by placing s on a queue . 
 • At each stage , dequeue a vertex v. 
 • Find all vertices w adjacent to v such that d > d + 𝐶 . Update d and p , and place 
 w v w w 
 𝑣,𝑤 
 w on a queue if it is not already there . 
 ( A bit can be set for each vertex to indicate 
 presence in the queue . ) 
 • Repeat the process until the queue is empty . 
 32 
 Graphs with Negative Edge Costs 
 Pseudocode for weighted shortest - path algorithm with negative edge costs 
 • 
 This algorithm works if there are no negative - cost cycles . 
 It is no longer true that the code in the inner for loop is executed once per 
 edge . 
 • Each vertex can dequeue at most |V| times , so the running time is O(|E| · |V| ) 
 if adjacency lists are used ( Exercise 9.7(b ) ) . 
 • This is quite an increase from ’s algorithm 
 • BUT it is fortunate that , in practice , edge costs are non - negative . 
 • If negative - cost cycles are present , then 
 • the algorithm as written will loop indefinitely . 
 33 
 Acyclic Graphs 
 • 
 If the graph is known to be acyclic , Dijkstra ’s algorithm can be improved by 
 changing the order in which vertices are declared known , called the vertex 
 selection rule . 
 • The new rule is to select vertices in topological order . 
 • This selection rule works because when a vertex v is selected , its distance , dv , 
 can no longer be lowered , since by the topological ordering rule it has no 
 incoming edges emanating from unknown nodes . 
 • There is no need for a priority queue with this selection rule ; 
 • The running time is O(|E| + |V| ) , since the selection takes constant time . 
 34 
 Examples of Applications of Acyclic Graphs 
 • Modelling some downhill skiing problem : getting from point a to b , but can 
 only go downhill , so clearly there are no cycles . 
 • Modelling of ( nonreversible ) chemical reactions : 
 • each vertex could represent a particular state of an experiment , 
 • edges would represent a transition from one state to another , and 
 • the edge weights might represent the energy released . 
 • 
 If only transitions from a higher energy state to a lower one are allowed , the graph is 
 acyclic . 
 • 
 Critical path analysis : 
 • Each node represents an activity that must be performed , along with the time it takes to 
 complete the activity . 
 This graph is thus known as an activity - node graph . 
 • The edges represent precedence relationships : An edge ( v , w ) means that activity v must 
 be completed before activity w may begin . 
  the graph must be acyclic . 
 • It is assumed that any activities that do not depend ( directly or indirectly ) on each other 
 can be performed in parallel by different servers . 
 35 
 Applications of Acyclic Graphs – Critical Path Analysis 
 Critical path analysis : 
 • Such a graph could be ( and frequently 
 is ) used to model construction projects . 
 Important questions : 
 • What is the earliest completion time for 
 the project ? 
 36 
 Applications of Acyclic Graphs – Critical Path Analysis 
 • To perform these calculations , the activity - node graph is converted to an event - node graph . 
 • Each event corresponds to the completion of an activity and all its dependent activities . 
 • Events reachable from a node v in the event - node graph may not commence until after the 
 event v is completed . 
 • 
 This graph can be constructed automatically or by hand . 
 • Dummy edges and nodes may need to be inserted in the case where an activity depends on 
 several others . 
 • This is necessary in order to avoid introducing false dependencies ( or false lack of them ) . 
 • Since the event - node graph is acyclic , we need not worry about cycles . 
 • In this case , it is easy to adapt the shortest - path algorithm to compute the earliest 
 completion time for all nodes in the graph . 
 • If EC is the earliest completion time for node i , then the applicable rules are 
 i 
 EC = 0 and 𝐸𝐶 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝐸𝐶 + 𝐶 ) 
 1 𝑤 ( 𝑣,𝑤 ) ∈ 𝐸 𝑣 𝑣,𝑤 
 38 
 Critical Path Analysis - Event - node graph 
 • One can also compute the latest completion time , LC , that each event can 
 i 
 finish without affecting the final completion time . 
 The formulas to do this are : 
 LC = EC and 𝐿𝐶 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ( 𝐿𝐶 − 𝐶 ) 
 n n 𝑣 ( 𝑣,𝑤 ) ∈ 𝐸 𝑤 𝑣,𝑤 
 • 
 These values can be computed in linear time by maintaining , for each vertex , a 
 list of all adjacent and preceding vertices . 
 • 
 The earliest completion times are computed for vertices by their topological 
 order , and the latest completion times are computed by reverse topological order . 
 39 
 Critical Path Analysis - Event - node graph 
 • 
 The slack time for each edge in the event - node graph represents the amount of time that the 
 completion of the corresponding activity can be delayed without delaying the overall 
 completion . 
 • It is easy to see that 𝑆𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑘 = 𝐿𝐶 − 𝐸𝐶 − 𝐶 
 𝑤 𝑣 𝑣,𝑤 
 𝑣 𝑤 
 , 
 • In the figure , for each vertex : Earliest completion time : the top number ; 
 Latest completion time : the bottom entry . 
 These are critical activities , which must finish on schedule .
