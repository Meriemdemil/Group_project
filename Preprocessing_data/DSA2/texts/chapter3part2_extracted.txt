 Abstract Data Types ( ADT ) 
 Abstract Data Types 
 • ADT : set of objects together with a set of operations 
 • 
 Mathematical abstraction ; no mention in ADT of 
 how the set of operations is implemented 
 • 
 Examples : Objects such as lists , sets , and graphs , 
 along with their operations , can be viewed as ADTs 
 The C++ class allows for the implementation of 
 ADTs , with appropriate hiding of implementation 
 details 
 • Any implementation changes should not affect the 
 use of the ADT ( completely transparent to the rest of 
 the programme ) 
 2 
 Usual Data Types 
 Integer , Double , Boolean 
 Implementation details of these are not known 
 Some operations on these can be defined : add , 
 multiply , read , write 
 The programmer just uses these operations 
 without knowing their implementation . 
 The List ADT 
 A Linked List consists of a sequence of nodes 
 • 
 Head 
 3 5 2 
 10 
 NULL 
 Tail 
 struct ListNode { 
 int value ; 
 ListNode * next ; 
 • Since the elements in memory are stored 
 randomly , the elements are accessed 
 sequentially ; no direct access is allowed . 
 Doubly Linked Lists 
 A node contains pointers to previous and next 
 element 
 One can move in both directions

 Advantages Of DLLs 
 • Reversing the doubly linked list is very easy . 
 • It can allocate or reallocate memory easily during its 
 execution . 
 • As with a singly linked list , it is the easiest data 
 structure to implement ( not considering arrays ) . 
 • The traversal of this doubly linked list is bidirectional 
 which is not possible in a singly linked list . 
 • Deletion of nodes is easy as compared to a Singly 
 Linked List . 
 A singly linked list deletion requires a 
 pointer to the node and previous node to be deleted but 
 in the doubly linked list , it only requires the pointer 
 which is to be deleted . 
 Disadvantages of DLLs 
 • It uses extra memory when compared to the 
 array and singly linked list . 
 • Since the elements in memory are stored 
 randomly , the elements are accessed 
 sequentially ; no direct access is allowed . 
 Uses of DLLs 
 • Used by the browser to implement backward and forward 
 navigation of visited web pages ( back and forward buttons ) 
 • Used by various applications to implement undo and redo 
 functionality . 
 • 
 Also in many operating systems , the thread scheduler ( the 
 code that chooses what process needs to run at which time ) 
 maintains a doubly - linked list of all processes running at 
 that time . 
 • Other data structures like stacks , Hash Tables , Binary 
 trees can also be constructed or programmed using a doubly- 
 linked list . 
 • Used in the navigation systems where front and back 
 navigation are required . 
 ( See also Search in AI ) 
 • We can go to any node and traverse from any 
 node . 
 We just need to stop when we visit the 
 same node again . 
 Applications of 
 Circular Linked Lists 
 • Used in multiplayer games to swap between 
 players . 
 • 
 On Operating Systems : Multiple running 
 applications can be placed in a CLL so the OS 
 keeps on iterating over these applications giving 
 them time slices . 
 ( Round Robin Scheduling ) 
 • Music or media player : the use of CLLs allows 
 for a continuous playback of the playlist 
 30 
 All of these operations take constant time . 
 o Deletion is called “ pop ’’ 
 o Addition is called “ push ’’ 
 • You can also test whether the stack is empty but 
 nothing else . 
 31 
 EXAMPLE 
 Push 5 , 3 , 1 , Pop , Pop , Push 7 
 1 
 3

 5 
 5 5 
 Push 3 Push 1 
 Push 5 
 Get 1 
 Get 3 
 7

 5

 5 
 Pop Pop Push 7

 Function Calls 
 • When a subroutine calls another subroutine 
 ( including itself ) the system must first store its 
 register contents . 
 • So , the system pushes the register contents onto 
 a stack . 
 • The new function uses the registers . 
 • When the program returns to the old function , 
 the system pops the stack . 
 • Nested Functions and Stack Overflow ! 
 33 
 Stack Implementation using an 
 Array 
 • Need to know the maximum number of 
 elements 
 Push the beginning symbols you wish to match , 
 ignore the rest . 
 Push brace , parentheses , brackets , ignore the 
 Whenever you encounter a right symbol , pop an element 
 from the stack . 
 If stack is empty , then error . 
 Otherwise , if the popped element is the corresponding 
 left symbol , then fine ; else there is an error . 
 What is the complexity of the operation ? 
 O(n ) 
 40 
 EXAMPLE 
 Check braces , brackets , parentheses matching 
 [ a+b{1 * 2]9 * 1}+(2 - 1 ) 
 Push [ , Push { , Pop , Pop , Push ( , Pop 
 { 
 [ 
 [ 
 Push { 
 Push [ 
 Oops ! Something 
 Get { wrong , was expecting [ 
 [ 
 Pop Expecting [ 
 41 
 EXAMPLE 
 Check brace , bracket parentheses matching 
 [ a+b{1 * 2}9 * 1]+(2 - 1 ) 
 Push [ , Push { , Pop , Pop , Push ( , Pop 
 Get { 
 { 
 [ 
 [ [ 
 Push { Pop 
 Push [ 
 Perfect ! 
 Expect { 
 Get ( 
 Get [

 Pop Expect [ 
 Push ( Pop Expect (

 Evaluation of arithmetic expressions 
 A*B + C 
 A*(B + C ) 
 A+B+C*D 
 A*D+B+C*E 
 To do the correct operation , the calculator needs 
 to know the priorities of the operators 
 We do n’t need any priority nor parentheses if the 
 operation is expressed in postfix or reverse 
 polish notation . 
 43 
 Postfix Notation 
 Infix notation Postfix notation 
 A*B + C AB*C+ 
 A*(B + C ) 
 ABC+ * 
 A+B+C*D AB+CD*+ 
 A*D+B+C*E AD*B+CE*+ 
 Suppose the expression is in postfix , how do we 
 compute the value ? 
 ( N.B. : Postfix notation already 
 takes into account operators priorities . ) 
 Computation of a Postfix Expression 
 Whenever you see a number push it in the stack . 
 At the end Pop to get the answer 
 Complexity ? 
 EXAMPLE 
 Compute 5 * 4 + 6 + 7 * 2 
 Think which data structure you could 
 use to implement the evaluation of an expression 
 written in polish ( prefix ) notation . 
 And how would 
 you do it ?

 Queues 
 • A Queue is a Linked List where an element is inserted at the 
 end ( back ) , and deleted from the beginning ( front ) of the list 
 • Thus insertion and deletion work at different ends 
 • This type of service is called First In First Out ( FIFO ) 
 50 
 Linked List Implementation of a Queue 
 • Insert at the Back of the linked list 
 o 
 Maintain a pointer to the last element 
 Whenever there is insertion , update this 
 pointer Back to point to the newly 
 inserted element . 
 • Delete from the beginning of the linked list . 
 Use the Front pointer 
 • Start inserting from the beginning of the array . 
 – Insert at the end of the current list ( Back ) 
 • When an element is deleted from the beginning 
 ( Front ) , DO NOT move all elements forward 
 – Just mark the position as blank . 
 55 
 Any problem ? 
 • We will soon reach the end of the array even 
 though there are spaces in the beginning to insert 
 in . 
 • Roll back to the beginning .
