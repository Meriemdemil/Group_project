 Konigsberg Bridge Problem 
 Bridge 3 not crossed

 Euler Solution 
 To cross all bridges once , each land mass needs an even number of bridges

 This necessary condition did not hold in Konigsberg , as some land 
 masses were connected to an odd number of bridges . 
 The Birth of Graph Theory 
 • abstracted away the physical details of the Problem to focus 
 on its fundamental network properties . 
 • By doing so , he was able to prove that the desired path did not exist 
 based on the network 's topological properties . 
 • 's approach laid the foundations for graph theory 
 • 
 Graph theory is now used to study networks in various fields , such as 
 social and computer networks . 
 • Imagine other applications … 
 The theory of graphs is a mathematical tool that provides a way to analyze 
 and solve problems involving networks .

 What is a graph ? 
 • 
 • To draw a graph , we place each vertex at a point and connect them 
 with curves to represent the edges .

 What is a graph ? 
 Simple Graph vs General Graph 
 • 
 Simple Graph is an graph that does not have multiple edges or self- 
 loops . 
 Connected vs disconnected graphs 
 • A graph is connected if it can not be expressed as a union of graphs . 
 Degree of vertices 
 • 
 The degree 𝒅𝒆𝒈(𝝂 ) of a vertex 𝜈 is the number of edges incident with 𝜈. 
 • 
 For any undirected graph , the total sum of degrees of all vertices is an 
 even number , which is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph . 
 It is thus an even number . 
 Handshaking lemma 
 For any undirected graph , the total sum of degrees of all vertices is an 
 even number , which is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph . 
 • A graph 𝐻 is a subgraph of a graph 𝐺 if 
 • Each of its vertices belongs to 𝑉(𝐺 ) . 
 • Each of its edges belongs to 𝐸(𝐺 ) . 
 • Subgraphs can be obtained by deleting edges and vertices .

 Matrix representations of graphs provide 
 • Useful tool for studying and analysing graphs . 
 Graph types 
 • Regular graphs 
 • A graph in which each vertex has the same degree . 
 • If each vertex has degree r , the graph is r - regular . 
 Cubic graph called also the graph .

 Bipartite graphs 
 Directed graph ( digraph ) D consists of finite vertex - set 𝑽(𝑫 ) and a finite 
 family arc - family 𝐴(𝐷 ) of ordered pairs of vertices called arcs . 
 • An arc is abbreviated to 𝒗𝒘 , where 𝒗 and 𝒘 are vertices . 
 • The ordering of the vertices in an arc is indicated by an arrow . 
 The underlying graph of 𝐷 is the graph obtained from 𝐷 by ' removing the 
 arrows ' 
 31 
 Directed graph ( digraph ) 
 • 𝑉(𝐷 ) = { 𝑢 , 𝑣 , 𝑤 , 𝑧 } 
 • 𝐴(𝐷 ) = { 𝑢𝑣 , 𝑤 , 𝑣𝑤 ( 𝑡𝑤𝑖𝑐𝑒 ) , 𝑤𝑣 , 𝑤𝑢 , 𝑧𝑤 } 
 32 
 Directed graph ( digraph ) 
 The underlying graph 
 • 𝑉(𝐷 ) = { 𝑢 , 𝑣 , 𝑤 , 𝑧 } 
 • 𝐴(𝐷 ) = { 𝑢𝑣 , 𝑤 , 𝑣𝑤 ( 𝑡𝑤𝑖𝑐𝑒 ) , 𝑤𝑣 , 𝑤𝑢 , 𝑧𝑤 } 
 33 
 Simple digraph 
 • 𝐷 is a simple digraph if : 
 • The arcs of 𝐷 are all distinct 
 • There are no “ loops ” arcs of the form 𝑣𝑣 ) . 
 • The underlying graph of a simple digraph need not be a simple graph 
 34 
 Connectedness and Degrees in Directed Graphs 
 • 
 The underlying graph of 𝐷 is a connected graph . 
 Handshaking lemma in Directed graphs 
 For any directed graph , the sum of all the in - degrees is equal to the sum 
 of all the out - degrees .

 Adjacency Matrix of a Digraph 
 No letter is adjacent to a letter that is next to it in the alphabet . 
 To solve the problem : 
 • A graph is created with people represented as vertices 
 • 
 Solid / Dotted edges indicating whether they know each other or no . 
 • The goal is to prove that there will always be 
 • A solid or dotted triangle present in the graph . 
 To solve this problem , we represent each cube by a graph using R , B , 
 G , and Y as vertices . 
 • The subgraphs have no edges in common , indicating that front / back faces are 
 different from the side faces . 
 Conclusion 
 • Graph theory is an abstraction of some problems that : 
 • Provides a systematic approach to problem - solving . 
 • Essential for developing problem - solving skills in mathematics and other fields . 
 • Has significant applications in diverse areas of study .
