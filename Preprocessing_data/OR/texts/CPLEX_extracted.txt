CPLEX IBM solver 
 
 CPLEX Toolkit 
 • CPLEX allows one to work in several ways . 
 • An IDE that uses the OPL modeling language 
 • An interactive command - line optimizer 
 • A callable library in several languages 
 • Java 
 • Python 
 • C 
 • C++ ( Concert Technology ) 
 • ... 
 CPLEX & Optimization Programming Language ( OPL ) 
 • Math - like Modelling Language 
 • Clean separation between model and data 
 • CPLEX solver for mathematical models 
 • Solve linear , quadratic , and quadratically 
 constrained programs 
 Why do we use CPLEX ? 
 • 
 CPLEX is a state - of - the - art commercial solver 
 • It is in active development and is continuously improved 
 • 
 It is widely used in both academia and industry

 Describing an optimization problem 
 • 
 OPL is a domain - specific language , created for describing optimization 
 problems . 
 • What must we define ? 
 • Constants / parameters used in the problem . 
 • Decision variables used in the problem . 
 • Objective function : linear objective function . 
 • Constraints : linear inequalities defining the feasible region . 
 Configuration file : 
 • Specifies the solver and other settings for the 
 OPL project . 
 Data file(s ): 
 • Data input for the OPL model . 
 • It includes parameters , decision variables , and 
 constraints . 
 Settings file : 
 • Additional settings and options for the OPL 
 project . 
 Representing a problem 
 • OPL separates the model and its instance . 
 • Model : .mod extension , describes the structure of a problem . 
 • Instance : .dat extension ( or can be baked into .mod ) , describes the data in a 
 problem . 
 • Any linear program has the same structure . 
 Only the data changes ! 
 • Products : Ammoniac gas ( NH3 ) and ammonium chloride ( NH4Cl )
