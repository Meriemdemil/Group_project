 Origine of Operations Research ( OR ) 
 Who were the first Operations Research teams ? 
 Origine of Operations Research ( OR ) 
 ● Large number of scientists are called to apply a scientific approach to 
 address strategic and tactical problems 
 ● Results 
 ○ Scarce resources allocation to military operations 
 ○ Deployment of radar 
 ○ Convoy management 
 ○ … 
 The origins of operations research ( OR ) is the a time of war , when highly intelligent 
 scientists came together to tackle crucial problems . 
 5 
 OR from War to Business and Research 
 ● 
 Scientists motivated to pursue OR research , leading to significant advancements in the field 
 ● 
 Emergence of components with separate goals 
 ● Conflict between components 
 ● Difficulty in resource allocation 
 Emergence of Operations Research ( OR ) to solve these 
 problems 
 7 
 OR and computer 
 revolution 
 ● 
 The computer revolution was a 
 major boost to OR 's development 
 ● 
 The continued acceleration of 
 computer power has contributed 
 to the growth of OR

 What is Operations Research ( OR ) ? 
 Operations Research 
 Operations : 
 ● problems related to operations within organizations 
 Research : 
 ● scientific method to investigate the problem 
 Observation and formulation 
 ○ 
 Building a mathematical model 
 ○ 
 Testing the model . 
 ○ 
 Nature of Operations 
 Research ( OR ) 
 Organizational 
 point of view 
 ● OR adopts an organizational 
 point of view and considers the 
 best for the organization as a 
 whole 
 Optimal 
 solution 
 ● OR searches for the best 
 possible solution ( optimal ) not 
 only an acceptable solution 
 Team 
 approach 
 ● OR requires a team approach , 
 as no single individual can have 
 expertise in all aspects of OR

 What are the decision alternatives ? 
 Tickets purchasing problem 
 What are the restrictions for making the decision ? 
 Objective criterion 
 The cheapest ticket price . 
 Alternatives costs 
 a. 
 Alternative a : Cost : $ 2000 ( 5 * $ 400 ) 
 b. 
 The best alternative is the one with the smallest cost 
 16 
 Challenge : what are the decision alternatives ? 
 ● How many alternatives exist ? 
 ● Is there a cheaper alternative to the options offered ? 
 ● What is the cost of this alternative ? 
 Example : Garden 
 problem 
 ● A homeowner is starting a 
 backyard vegetable garden 
 ● The garden must be 
 rectangular and fenced to 
 keep critters out 
 Fence the largest possible 
 ● The owner has enough 
 material to build a fence of 
 rectangular area 
 length L = 100 ft

 Example : Wozac 
 production process 
 ● 
 Eli Daisy produces Wozac by 
 heating a chemical mixture in a 
 pressurized container 
 ● 
 The production process results 
 in different amounts of Wozac 
 produced each time 
 ● 
 The amount produced is called 
 Understand the factors that 
 the process yield , measured in 
 pounds 
 influence the yield . 
 24 
 Wozac Production Process 
 ● 
 Model - building process should be used 
 Decision variables : factors influencing Wozac production yield : 
 ○ Container volume ( V ) , Container pressure ( P ) , Container temperature ( T ) 
 ○ A , B , and C be percentage of mixture made up of chemicals A , B , and C 
 ● Model : descriptive model that describes behavior of actual yield 
 ○ 
 Regression methods used to determine influence 
 ○ 
 Find the model parameters based on the data 
 25 
 Constraints in Wozac Production Process 
 What are the restrictions for making the decision on Wozak Production Process ? 
 ● Volume ( V ) between 1 and 5 liters 
 ● Pressure between 200 and 400 milliliters 
 ● Temperature between 100 and 200 degrees Celsius 
 ● 
 Mixture must be made of A , B , and C 
 ● 
 Wozac Production Process 
 27 
 Wozac Production Process 
 Any values of decision variables that meet constraints is in feasible region 
 ● 
 Optimal solution is a point in feasible region that optimizes objective function 
 ● 
 Use an OR method to determine the optimal solution for the model 
 ● 
 Optimal solution : 
 ○ 5 - liter container , 200 milliliters pressure , 100 degrees Celsius temperature , 29 % 
 A and 71 % C 
 ○ Maximum yield of 183.38 pounds can be obtained with the optimal solution 
 28 
 Modeling in OR 
 ● 
 Model expresses the 
 behavior in an easily 
 understandable manner 
 Dominant variables are 
 concentrated 
 Model is a simplified representation 
 ● 
 Example : UPS- Optimize delivery itineraries 
 Problem : 
 ● UPS introduced ORION software to provide tailored delivery itineraries 
 ● 
 The software proposed shorter routes , leading to potential savings 
 ● 
 Drivers did n't like the idea of a machine " beating " them

 UPS- Optimize delivery itineraries 
 Problem : 
 ● UPS introduced ORION software to provide tailored delivery itineraries 
 ● 
 The software proposed shorter routes , leading to potential savings 
 ● 
 Drivers did n't like the idea of a machine " beating " them 
 Solution : 
 ● ORION developers added a button " Beat the Computer " 
 ● 
 Drivers took the challenge , some beat computer - suggested routes 
 Perception of ORION changed from a threat to a complement to drivers ' experience
