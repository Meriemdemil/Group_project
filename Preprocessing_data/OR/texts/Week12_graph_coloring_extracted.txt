 Module distribution concerns raised by students 
 • Issues 
 • Multiple difficult modules scheduled in the same term 
 • Unbalanced distribution of workload between terms 
 • Goal 
 • Achieving a balanced load distribution between terms 
 • Approach : 
 • Represent modules as vertices 
 • High - load modules are linked by edges 
 • Assign colors to terms 
 • Ensure that difficult and high - load modules are not scheduled in the same term . 
 Find optimal module - term assignment to minimize load imbalance 
 and avoid clustering high - load modules .

 What is graph coloring ? 
 • In the context of a simple graph G , a k - coloring refers to the assignment of 
 at most k colors to its vertices . 
 • k - coloring should color the adjacent vertices in G by different colors . 
 • If G has a valid k - coloring , we say G is k - colorable . 
 • The chromatic number of G , denoted by 𝜒(𝐺 ) , is the smallest number k for 
 which G is k - colorable . 
 • Reason for restricting coloring to simple graphs : 
 • Vertex with loop can not be assigned a different color from itself . 
 • 
 Subgraphs and the Chromatic Number 
 • 
 Subgraphs play a crucial role in understanding the chromatic number of a 
 graph . 
 • If a subgraph 𝐻 of 𝐺 has a chromatic number 𝜒(H ) , then 𝜒(G ) must also be 
 at least that value . 
 • The presence of complete subgraphs ( cliques ) can increase the chromatic 
 number of a graph . 
 The subgraphs with the highest chromatic numbers can provide insights 
 into the chromatic number of the entire graph . 
 Graph is bipartite . 
 What is the chromatic number ? 
 If the maximum vertex degree of a graph is low , we can determine a tight 
 upper bound for the chromatic number . 
 • However , for graphs with a high maximum degree , this theorem becomes less 
 effective or loses its usefulness . 
 By 
 our assumption , we have 𝜒(𝐻 ) ≤ 𝑑 + 1 . 
 • By assigning an unassigned color to 𝒗 , we can create a ( 𝑑+1)-coloring 
 of 𝐺. 
 Chromatic Number 𝜒(𝐺 ) and Bounds 
 • We color 𝑣 with this unsaigned color . 
 • Intuition : 
 • 
 For planar graphs , it is possible to color them using only 5 colors or fewer 
 • It demonstrates the inherent simplicity within complex spatial configurations . 
 A vertex coloring of G has been obtained . 
 THEORME 6 
 For any graph G , there is a labelling of the vertices for which the greedy 
 algorithm yields a vertex colouring with 𝜒(𝐺 ) colours . 
 • As a result , only 𝜒(𝐺 ) colors are needed for this labeling . 
 Coloring Problems : Storing Chemicals 
 • Certain chemicals react violently when they are 
 in contact . 
 • 
 The manufacturer plans to divide the 
 warehouse into regions to separate dangerous 
 chemical pairs . 
 • The dangerous pairs of chemicals are marked 
 with an asterisk in a table . 
 The objective is to find the minimum number of 
 areas required to safely store the chemicals . 
 Coloring Problems 
 • To determine the minimum number of areas required for safe chemical 
 storage , a graph was created . 
 • Each vertex represent chemical . 
 • Vertices are adjacent when the corresponding chemicals need to be separated . 
 Assigning chemicals to areas is a vertex coloring problem , with colors 
 corresponding to the areas . 
 • A vertex coloring leads to a vertex decomposition of the graph , where no 
 adjacent vertices are in the same subset . 
 • The minimum number of subsets required for this problem is the 
 chromatic number 𝜒(𝐺 ) of this graph .

 Register allocation 
 • Register allocation can be seen as a graph 
 coloring problem . 
 • Nodes in the graph represent the live ranges of 
 variables . 
 • The objective is to assign colors to nodes such 
 that adjacent nodes have different colors . 
 The chromatic number represents the minimum 
 number of registers required .
