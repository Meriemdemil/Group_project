 Applications of Planar Graphs 
 • Urban Planning 
 • Planar graphs model utility line layouts , ensuring non - crossing connections between houses . 
 • Computer - Aided Design 
 • They are used in electronic system design , such as integrated circuits , for optimal layout and 
 minimized total area . 
 • Network Design 
 • Network topologies are represented as planar graphs to aim for non - interfering connections . 
 • Subway Route Planning 
 • Planar graphs aid in efficient route determination for subway lines , reducing intersections to 
 prevent congestion and bottlenecks . 
 Applications of Planar Graphs 
 • 
 Graph Drawing 
 • Planar graphs are crucial in graph drawing for software engineering , databases , data visualization , and more . 
 • Wireless Communication 
 • In wireless ad hoc networks , planar graphs represent possible communication paths , minimizing interference 
 and ensuring efficient communication . 
 • Scheduling 
 • Certain scheduling problems can be modelled as planar graphs , helping to organize overlapping tasks . 
 • Maze Solving Algorithms 
 • Planar graphs are useful for maze generation and solving algorithms , representing corridors and junctions in 
 the maze . 
 Any situation involving connected " points " without overlap can 
 potentially use planar graphs . 
 What is planar graph ? 
 • Definition : 
 A planar graph can be drawn in a plane without edge crossings , with edges 
 only intersecting at vertices they 're incident to . 
 • Plane Drawing ( embedding ) 
 • Any drawing of a planar graph without crossings . 
 • Plane Graph 
 • An abbreviation used for a plane drawing of a planar graph . 
 Not all drawings of a planar graph are plane graphs . 
 Only those without 
 edge crossings qualify as plane graphs .

 Subdivision of a graph 
 • 
 • A graph H is contractible to a 
 graph G , if we can obtain H by 
 successively contracting the 
 edges of G. 
 THEOREM 3

 Cycle Method for Planarity Testing 
 • 
 The Cycle Method is a heuristic algorithm used to test whether a given graph is planar . 
 • It is applicable to small graphs with a Hamiltonian cycle , providing a quick and intuitive 
 planarity test . 
 • 
 B : Edges that can be drawn outside C without crossing . 
 If it is possible to allocate all remaining edges to A and B without crossings , G is planar . 
 If it is not possible to allocate the remaining edges without crossings , G is non - planar . 
 • Incompatibility of edges 
 • Incompatible edges can not both be drawn inside C or both be drawn outside C without crossings . 
 • Compatible edges can be drawn inside or outside C without crossings . 
 Example 
 Example 
 • ac bd df 
 • ad bg eh 
 • ae bi fh 
 • ah gi 
 • A = { ac } 
 • We put incompatible with A in B 
 • B = { bd , bg , bi } 
 Example 
 • ac bd df 
 • ad bg eh 
 • ae bi fh 
 • ah gi 
 • B = { bd , bg , bi } 
 • We add incompatible edges with B in A 
 • A = { ac , ad , ae , eh , fh , ah } 
 Example 
 • ac bd df 
 • ad bg eh 
 • ae bi fh 
 • ah gi 
 • A = { ac , ad , ae , eh , fh , ah } 
 • We add incompatible edges with A in B 
 • B = { bd , bg , bi , df , gi } 
 Example 
 • ac bd df 
 • ad bg eh 
 • ae bi fh 
 • ah gi 
 • A = { ac , ad , ae , eh , fh , ah } 
 • We add incompatible edges with A in B 
 • B = { bd , bg , bi , df , gi } 
 Example 
 Faces in planar graph 
 • 
 Any plane drawing of planar graph 𝐺 
 divides the set of points of the plane into 
 regions , called faces . 
 • Example : 
 • Faces of the 𝐾 : 𝑓 , 𝑓 , 𝑓 , 𝑓 . 
 4 1 2 3 4 
 • 𝑓 is infinite face . 
 • In any plane drawing of a planar graph , the sum of all the face 
 degrees is equal to twice the number of edges . 
 Hence , the theorem holds true . 
 • Inductive Step 
 • Assume the theorem holds for all plane graphs with at most 𝑚 − 1 edges . 
 • Consider 𝐺 , a plane graph with 𝑚 edges . 
 The graph 𝑮 − 𝒆 is connected , with 𝒏 vertices , 𝒎 − 𝟏 edges , and 𝑭 − 𝟏 faces . 
 By the induction hypothesis , we can write : 𝒏 − ( 𝒎 − 𝟏 ) + ( 𝑭 − 𝟏 ) = 𝟐. 
 • 
 Hence , simplifying , we obtain : 𝒏 − 𝒎 + 𝑭 = 𝟐 , which completes the proof .

 relationships between the faces of 
 planar graph .

 the original graph . 
 • Connect the vertices if the 
 corresponding faces share an edge .
