 • INTRODUCTION 
 We have seen that , via 's formula , we can approximate a 
 function 𝒇 by a polynomial . 
 But in 's formula , we require the 
 function f to be regular or smooth , that is to say differentiable up to 
 order n on a neighborhood of the point 𝑥 . 
 On the other hand , this 
 0 
 regularity is not required to obtain a limited development of a 
 function . 
 This is the advantage of limited developments which make 
 it possible to approach regular or non - regular functions using 
 polynomials . 
 The other advantage is to use simple D.L. calculation 
 techniques to find the expansions , for regular functions , 
 without knowing the derivatives of 𝒇 at 𝑥 , and consequently , we 
 0 
 can simply obtain derivatives of 𝒇 at 𝑥 . 
 If f is odd then 
 𝑎 = 𝑎 = ⋯ = 𝑎 = 0

 Proof : 
 Suppose f is even . 
 But there 
 is also a condition that the function f must satisfy 
 to admit a L.D , at zero .
