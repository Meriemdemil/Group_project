 GENERALIZED INTEGRALS 
 Example 
 The following integrals are improper integrals . 
 Let f be a function defined on the interval [ a , b [ , where 
 −∞ < a < b ≤ + ∞. If b is infinite or if f is unbounded as x approaches 
 b , we say that the integral has a singularity at b , denoted by 
 ( cid:90 ) ∗b 
 f(x)dx .

 Definition 
 Let f be a function defined on [ a , b [ . 
 We say that f is locally integrable on 
 [ a , b [ if it is integrable over every closed and bounded interval 
 [ α , β ] ⊂ [ a , b [ .

 Integral with a Single Singularity 
 This is denoted by 
 f ∈ R ( [ a , b [ ) , 
 loc 
 indicating that f is locally Riemann - integrable on [ a , b [ . 
 For the rest of this section , we consider only locally integrable functions .

 Convergent Integrals 
 Let f ∈ R ( [ a , b [ ) , and let 
 loc 
 ( cid:90 ) t 
 F(t ) = f(x)dx . 
 The function F is well - defined on [ a , b [ because f is locally integrable on 
 [ a , b [ . 
 Definition 
 If the limit lim F(t ) exists and is finite , we say that the improper 
 t→b− 
 integral 
 ( cid:90 ) ∗b 
 f(x)dx 
 a 
 is convergent . Moreover , 
 ( cid:90 ) ∗b ( cid:90 ) t 
 f(x)dx = lim F(t ) = lim f(x)dx . 
 a t→b− t→b− a 
 If the integral is not convergent , we say it is divergent .

 Positive Functions 
 It is said that the set of convergent integrals forms a vector space . 
 If we 
 ( cid:82)t 
 can calculate the ” partial ” integral f(x)dx for all t ∈]a , b [ , then we 
 a 
 ( cid:82)(cid:63)b 
 can study the convergence of the integral f(x)dx by taking the limit . 
 a 
 ( cid:82)t 
 However , in many cases , calculating f(x)dx directly might not be 
 a 
 feasible . 
 Therefore , we need convergence criteria that do not rely on the 
 ( cid:82)t 
 calculation of the ” partial ” integral f(x)dx . 
 Moreover , there are criteria 
 a 
 that are particularly useful for functions with a constant sign in the vicinity 
 of a singularity . 
 For simplicity , let ’s assume these functions are positive . 
 According to the theorem above , it is sufficient for the function f to be 
 positive in the vicinity of the singularity . 
 However , for ease of exposition , 
 let ’s assume that f is positive on [ a , b [ . 
 Theorem 
 Let F be the function that is the primitive of f vanishing at a , defined by : 
 ( cid:90 ) t 
 F(t ) = f(x)dx 
 a 
 We then have : 
 Let f ∈ R ( [ a , b [ ) be a positive function on ] a , b [ . 
 The improper integral 
 loc 
 ( cid:82)(cid:63)b 
 f(x)dx is convergent if , and only if , the function F , is upper bounded 
 a 
 on ] a , b [ .

 Positive Functions 
 The following theorem is known as the comparison theorem and is 
 fundamental in the study of integrals of positive functions . 
 Theorem 
 Let f and g ∈ R ( [ a , b [ ) . Suppose 0 ≤ f(x ) ≤ g(x ) for all x ∈ [ a , b [ .

 Then we have the implication : 
 ( cid:90 ) ( cid:63)b ( cid:90 ) ( cid:63)b

 2 . 
 If l = 0 , then 
 ( cid:90 ) ( cid:63)b ( cid:90 ) ( cid:63)b 
 g(x)dx is convergent ⇒ f(x)dx is convergent . 
 If l = + ∞ , then 
 ( cid:90 ) ( cid:63)b ( cid:90 ) ( cid:63)b 
 g(x)dx is divergent ⇒ f(x)dx is divergent . 
 Example

 We know that 
 ( cid:82)∞ 
 e−x dx is convergent because

 t→+∞ 
 However , as 
 x3e−x 
 lim = lim x3 = + ∞ , 
 x→+∞ e−x x→+∞ 
 we can not apply the previous theorem directly . 
 But knowing that the 
 function 
 f(x ) = x3e−x 
 is positive on ] 1,+∞ [ , we can compare this function with g(x ) = e−x , for 
 which we already know that the integral 
 ( cid:82)∞ 
 e−x dx is convergent . 
 Indeed , 
 1 
 the comparison holds true , and according to the comparison theorem , if 
 ( cid:82)∞ 
 e−x dx is convergent , then 
 ( cid:82)∞ 
 x3e−x dx is also convergent .

 is a convergent Riemann integral , then our integral is also convergent . 
 Functions of Any Sign 
 In this section , we can not use the theorems mentioned previously , but we 
 still have some results that we can apply . 
 The integral f(x)dx is convergent if , and only 
 loc a 
 if , the following Cauchy condition is satisfied : 
 ( cid:12)(cid:90 ) x(cid:48)(cid:48 ) ( cid:12 ) 
 ∀ε > 0,∃c ∈]a , b[;∀x(cid:48),x(cid:48)(cid:48),x(cid:48),x(cid:48)(cid:48 ) ∈]c , b[⇒ ( cid:12 ) ( cid:12 ) f(x)dx ( cid:12 ) ( cid:12 ) < ε . 
 ( cid:12 ) x(cid:48 ) ( cid:12 ) 
 In order to use the comparison theorems , we study the integral of the 
 absolute value of f to reduce it to the case of an integral of a positive 
 function . Therefore , we study : 
 ( cid:90 ) ( cid:63)b 
 |f(x)|dx

 The following theorem provides sufficient conditions for the convergence of 
 the integral of a function of any sign . 
 Let f , g ∈ R ( [ a , b [ ) satisfying :

 This integral is an example of semi - convergent integrals . 
 For 
 example , in case ( a ) , the interval ] −∞,2 [ is unbounded , so the integral 
 has a singularity at v(−∞ ) , and the function is unbounded at v(2 ) , so the 
 integral has a singularity at v(2 ) .
