 Color Fundamentals 
 • We have seen that we perceive light radiation which is characterized 
 by a certain intensity and wavelength . 
 • 's intuition is that white is not a “ pure ” color , but is the 
 composition of several colors .

 Color Fundamentals 
 • The colors that humans and animals perceive in an object are determined by the nature 
 of the light ( wavelength ) reflected from the object . 
 • A body that favors reflectance in a limited range of the visible spectrum exhibits some 
 shades of color . 
 • Rods are responsible for vision in low - light conditions and do not detect color . 
 • Cones are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light . 
 • M - cones ( Medium - wavelength cones ): 
 • Most sensitive to green light ( peak sensitivity around 530 - 540 nm ) . 
 • Constitute about 32 - 40 % of all cones . 
 • L - cones ( Long - wavelength cones ): 
 • Most sensitive to red light ( peak sensitivity around 560 - 580 nm ) . 
 • Constitute about 55 - 65 % of all cones . 
 Human Vision 
 Human Vision : Color Blindness 
 • Color blindness ( color vision deficiency ) means you see colors differently than 
 most people . 
 • Most of the time , color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference 
 between certain colors . 
 • The most common type of color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the 
 difference between red and green . 
 • Another type makes blue and yellow look the same . 
 • There different types of color vision deficiencies .

 Human Vision : Color Blindness 
 The Ishihara Test is a widely used color vision test designed to detect color 
 blindness . 
 • The test consists of a series of circular plates ( Ishihara plates ) filled with colored dots . 
 • Each plate contains a hidden number or pattern made up of dots in a specific color . 
 • People with normal color vision can distinguish the numbers easily . 
 The Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage ( CIE ) is an organization that 
 sets standards for light , color , and vision . 
 • CIE is responsible for defining color spaces and mathematical models that 
 describe human color perception . 
 A color model is a mathematical structure for representing colors as sets of numbers . 
 Short - wavelength cones ( S ): Most sensitive to blue ( ~450 nm ) 
 Medium - wavelength cones ( M ): Most sensitive to green ( ~530 nm ) 
 Long - wavelength cones ( L ): Most sensitive to red ( ~600 nm )

 CIE RGB color matching function 
 • Almost all colors can be matched this way , except 
 some shades between blue and green that can not be 
 reproduced . 
 • 
 If we add some red to the test light , than we can 
 match it using only green and blue . 
 • We need a negative amount of red to obtain some 
 colors ! 
 17 
 Color Fundamentals 
 • The green light activates the red receptor more than the test light ( cyan ) . 
 • To obtain the same response , we need to reduce the activation of the red cones 
 ( subtract some red )

 The metamers 
 • These are different combinations of wavelengths of light that appear identical to the human 
 eye , despite having different spectral compositions .

 Color characteristics 
 • In the color wheel , any particular spot on the wheel from 0 to 
 360 degrees 
 is referred to as a hue . 
 • The hue specifies the specific tone of color . 
 22 
 Color Fundamentals 
 Hue : The Identity of Color 
 • Hue refers to the basic color on the spectrum , such as red , blue , or green . 
 It is essentially what 
 differentiates colors from one another . 
 • Hue is the foundation of color perception . 
 It is what differentiates a shade of red from a shade 
 of blue . 
 The concept of hue dates back to color wheel , which helped define 
 how colors relate to one another . 
 • While hue is a specific wavelength of light within the color spectrum , color is a broader term 
 that includes hue along with saturation and luminance . 
 • A bright pink and a deep maroon share the same hue ( red ) but differ in saturation and 
 luminance . 
 The intensity or purity of a color 
 • 
 Saturation is the intensity of a hue from gray tone ( no saturation ) to pure , vivid color ( high 
 saturation ) . 
 • Saturation plays a crucial role in setting the mood of an image : 
 • Highly saturated images convey energy and excitement , 
 • Highly saturated colors appear vivid and bold , 
 • Desaturated images evoke a softer or more subdued atmosphere . 
 • Luminance is essential for creating depth and contrast in an image . 
 A well - balanced luminance 
 scale ensures that details are visible without overexposing or underexposing parts of an 
 image . 
 • A color model is a mathematical structure for representing colors as sets of 
 numbers . 
 • A color model is a specification of : 
 ▪ A coordinate system 
 ▪ A subspace within that system where each color is represented by a single point .

 Color Models : RGB 
 Each corner of the cube corresponds to a specific color combination . 
 is the black corner , meaning no light is present ( no red , green , or blue ) . 
 Color Models : RGB 
 • 
 The RGB color model is widely used in electronic displays , such as televisions , computer 
 monitors , and digital cameras … 
 • These devices emit light to display images . 
  RGB is Device - dependent : Different displays use slightly different RGB primaries , 
 leading to variations in color reproduction . 
 While RGB is widely used in digital imaging , there are certain colors that can not be represented 
 accurately in this system . 
 • The exact range of colors ( gamut ) depends on the physical capabilities of the display or sensor . 
 • Some colors fall outside this gamut and can not be accurately represented : 
 • Spectral Colors Beyond RGB Primaries : Colors like pure cyan , pure yellow , and pure magenta 
 • 
 Extremely High - Saturation Colors : 
 Some deeply saturated colors , such as those found in the natural spectrum of light 
 ( e.g. , laser light , neon colors ) , exceed the limits of typical RGB displays .

 Color Models : 
 RGB 
 Problems with RGB ( 2/2 ): 
 • It is not easy to determine how much of R , G and B to use to make a given color . 
 RGB = ( ? , ? , ? ) 
 • It is also perceptually non - linear : 
 The Y axis corresponds to the luminance , 
 that is the perceived relative brightness . 
 Pure white = > a diagonal vector ( equal- 
 valued vector ) 
 34 
 Color Models : CIE XYZ 
 Problems with the XYZ : 
 Many points in XYZ do not corresponds to visible colors 
 XYZ is not realizable physically . 
 Color Models : XYZ 
 If we divide the XYZ values by the sum of X+Y+Z , we obtain the chromaticity 
 coordinates : 
 𝑿 𝒀 𝒁 
 𝒙 = , 𝒚 = , 𝒛 = . 
 𝑿+𝒀+𝒁 𝑿+𝒀+𝒁 𝑿+𝒀+𝒁 
  The CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram : 
 This diagram represents all the color that are visible by the average human eye . 
 Gamut and Color Mixing : 
 • The gamut of a display ( RGB monitors , printers , etc . ) is a triangle inside the 
 diagram , showing the range of reproducible colors . 
 37 
 The CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram : 
 The Gamut 
 Any device that reproduces colors by mixing a fixed set of 
 basic colors can only reproduce the colors within the convex 
 envelope of their basis . 
 Every point contained within this shape corresponds to a single color sensation . 
 Color Models 
 The CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram 
 A color model is defined by a triangle and the 
 white point . 
 If we chose a different triangle , we define a 
 different color models . 
 The same physical color will have different 
 coordinates if we consider different triangles 
 and hence different color models .

 Color Models : HSV 
 • The HSV ( Hue , Saturation , Value ) color model is an alternative to the RGB color model 
 • It is designed to be more aligned with how humans perceive and categorize colors . 
 Saturation ( S ): This represents the intensity or purity of the color . 
 represents the brightness of the color . 
 It ranges from 0 % to 100 % : 
 ▪ 0 % means the color is completely black , regardless of the hue and saturation . 
 ▪ 100 % means the color is at its full brightness , with no darkness added . 
 The Saturation ( S ) is represented by the distance from the center of the cylinder ( the center 
 represents no saturation , or gray , and the edge represents full saturation ) . 
 • The Value ( V ) is represented by the height of the cylinder , from the bottom ( dark ) to the top ( bright ) . 
 43 
 Color Models : HSV 
 • HSV model is more intuitive for humans . 
 • 
 HSV is often easier to understand for humans because it separates chromatic 
 content from brightness and mimics the way we perceive color . 
 • We think about colors in terms of hue ( red , green , etc . ) , how vivid they are 
 ( saturation ) , and how light or dark they are ( value ) . 
 • Its better for color manipulation . 
 In digital imaging and graphics , HSV is often used 
 in applications where you want to change the color ’s hue ( e.g. , shifting a color to a 
 different shade ) , adjust its brightness , or alter its vibrancy without affecting other 
 components . 
 44 
 Color Models : 
 HSV in practice 
 • HSV color model is typically represented as : 
 • 0 ° to 360 ° for Hue 
 • 0 to 100 % for Saturation and Value . 
 In OpenCV , the HSV color model is represented in a slightly different range : 
 Color Models : 
 From RGB to HSV 
 Applications of RGB to HSV Conversion : 
 • Image segmentation : HSV makes it easier to separate colors . 
 • Color filtering : Useful in OpenCV for detecting specific objects in images . 
 • Color adjustments : Easier to modify hue / saturation separately than in RGB . 
 base values : 
 • Compute C ( chroma ) = V × S. 
 • Compute X = C × ( 1−∣(H/60 ° ) mod 2−1∣ ) . 
 • Compute m = V − C.

 And Many Other Color Models 
 CMYK ( Cyan , Magenta , Yellow , Key / Black ) 
 • Used in printing : CMYK is designed for subtractive color mixing , where colors are 
 created by subtracting light from a white background . 
 • Components : 
 • Cyan ( C ) , Magenta ( M ) , Yellow ( Y ): The primary colors used in printing . 
 • Key ( K ): Black , used to deepen colors ( since it 's hard to achieve true black with 
 just CMY ) . 
 • Applications : Widely used in color printing ( e.g. , printers , publishing , graphic 
 design ) . 
 55 
 And Many Other Color Models 
 LAB ( CIELAB ) 
 • Perceptually Uniform : 
 LAB is a device - independent color model based on human 
 perception , designed to be uniform in terms of how we perceive color differences . 
 • Components : 
 • L : Lightness ( from black to white ) . 
 • A : Green to red axis . 
 • B : Blue to yellow axis . 
 • Applications : Used in color correction , image processing , and digital imaging as it 
 provides consistent color representation regardless of device . 
 • Conversion : It can be converted from / to RGB or XYZ easily . 
 And Many Other Color Models 
 YCbCr ( Luminance , Chrominance ) 
 • Used in video compression : YCbCr is a color space used in video and image 
 compression , especially in JPEG , MPEG , and video streaming . 
 • Components : 
 • Y : Luminance ( brightness ) – represents grayscale . 
 • Cb : Blue chrominance ( difference from blue channel ) . 
 • Cr : Red chrominance ( difference from red channel ) . 
 • Applications : 
 • Compression : YCbCr separates brightness from color to allow more efficient compression ( since 
 humans are more sensitive to brightness than to chroma ) . 
 • Broadcasting and video formats : Used in digital TV , image compression , and video editing .
