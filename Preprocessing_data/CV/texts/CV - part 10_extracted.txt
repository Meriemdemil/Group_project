 Random sample consensus : a paradigm for model fitting with applications to image analysis and automated 
 cartography . 
 • Given a dataset whose data elements contain both inliers and outliers , RANSAC 
 uses a consensus scheme to find the optimal fitting result . 
 RANSAC : The Random Sample Consensus Algorithm 
 RANSAC 
 • 
 It is a trial - and - error approach . 
 • Able to deal with high fractions of outliers in the data ( up to 50 % ) . 
 RANSAC : The Random Sample Consensus Algorithm 
 RANSAC 
 • Key idea : Find the best partition of inliers / outliers in the data and estimate the 
 model from the inlier subset . 
 • 
 It the standard / recommended approach for fitting in the presence of outliers .

 Assumptions 
 Select a random subset of the original data . 
 Call this subset the hypothetical inliers . 
 Test all other data against the model and mark points either as inliers or outliers according 
 to some loss function .

 In other words , 
 how often do we need to try ? 
 Select a random subset of the original data . 
 Call this subset the hypothetical inliers . 
 The model that produced the largest consensus set is selected 
 The Random Sample Consensus Algorithm 
 Select a random subset of the original data . 
 Call this subset the hypothetical inliers . 
 Test all other data against the model and mark points either as inliers or outliers 
 according to some loss function . 
 Fit the model to the set of inliers associated with the selected model .

 Applications 
 • Robust Line and Plane Fitting 
 Fit lines in 2D , planes in 3D , even when many points are outliers . 
 • Model Fitting in Object Recognition 
 Fit shapes ( lines , circles , ellipses , 3D models ) to detected features . 
 Recognize partially occluded or noisy objects . 
 • Pose Estimation ( PnP problem ) 
 Estimate a camera 's position and orientation from known 3D-2D point correspondences . 
 Used in robotics , AR , self - driving cars .
