 • Computer vision is the enterprise of building machines that can see . 
 • 
 Computer vision is an enterprise that uses statistical methods to 
 disentangle data using models constructed with the aid of geometry , 
 physics , and learning theory . 
 Introduction 
 • Computer vision as a field is an intellectual frontier : Exciting and 
 disorganized . 
 • Many useful ideas have no theoritical grounding 
 • Some theories are useless in practice . 
  Difficult to give a concise definition since the area spans multiple 
 different problems

 Introduction 
 • How we will consider compter vision in this course : 
 “ A set of computational techniques aiming at estimating or 
 making explicit the geometric and dynamic properties of the 3D 
 world from digital images . ” 
  We will prioritize a practical approach while introducing the 
 fundamental principles and concepts .

 Introduction 
 • A human has no problem analyzing the photo , counting the number of 
 people , classifying them ( female / male ) , estimating the ages of people , 
 recognizing people they know …

 • But for machines , it is another story ! 
 • These basic tasks are very challenging .

 Introduction : Human vision 
 13 
 • Researchers or scientists are able to create optical illusions to study and 
 analyze some aspects of how the brain processes visual information . 
 Introduction – Optical illusions 
 • « Optical illusions do n’t “ trick the eye ” , nor “ fool the brain ” , nor reveal that “ our 
 brain sucks ” , … but are fascinating ! 
 They also teach us about our visual 
 perception and its limitations .

 The visual system needs to determine the color of objects in the 
 world . 
 In this case the problem is to determine the gray shade 
 https://michaelbach.de/ot/lum- of the checks on the floor . 
 Just measuring the light coming from 
 a surface ( the luminance ) is not enough : a cast shadow will dim 
 adelsonCheckShadow / index.html 
 a surface , so that a white surface in shadow may be reflecting 
 less light than a black surface in full light . 
 This happens effortlessly and without the need to actively search for them . 
 The pop - out effect can be explained by the way the brain processes visual information , particularly 
 through mechanisms in the visual cortex and attentional systems . 
 The pop - out effect occurs because the brain is equipped with specialized neurons , parallel 
 processing , and attentional mechanisms that prioritize unique or salient visual features . 
 This 
 automatic , efficient system helps us navigate and respond to our surroundings with minimal effort . 
 Researchers study how the human visual system works . 
 • Why is vision so difficult ? 
 • Mainly because is an inverse problem . 
 • We seek to recover some unknowns given insufficient information to fully specify the solution . 
 Introduction – Definitions 
 • Computer vision is difficult because it often 
 involves solving an inverse problem : 
 • The goal is to infer the real - world properties of a 
 scene ( e.g. , objects , depth , lighting ) from a 2D 
 image or set of images . 
 • 
 The challenge arises because a 2D image contains 
 limited and ambiguous information , making it 
 impossible to uniquely determine the exact 3D 
 world that created it without additional 
 assumptions .

 Computer Vision : A Brief History 
 • 
 What started distinguishing computer vision from image processing were early attempts 
 to infer 3D structure from images : 
 Lines extraction and labelling , stereo correspondences , optical flow , structure from motion

 Computer Vision : A Brief History 
 While a lot of the previously mentioned topics continued to be explored , 
 a few of them became significantly more active : projective invariants , multiview 
 stereo , image segmentation …
