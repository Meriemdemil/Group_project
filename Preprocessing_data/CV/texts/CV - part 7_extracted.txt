 Image Features 
 What is a feature ? 
 • Local , meaningful , detectable parts of the image .

 Image Features in Computer Vision 
 What is a feature ? 
 • Location of sudden change 
 Why use features ? 
 • Information content is high 
 • Invariant to change of viewpoint or illumination 
 • Reduces computational burden

 Image Features in Computer Vision 
 A good feature is invariant to : 
 • Viewpoint 
 • Lighting conditions 
 • Object deformations 
 • Partial occlusions 
 and should be : 
 • Unique 
 • Easy to be found and extracted

 Edge detection : Introduction 
 • Find image pixels that present abrupt ( local ) 
 changes in intensity . 
 • Examples : Boundary between a black object and a white 
 background . 
 Edge detection : Introduction 
 Different edge models : Ramp edges 
 • Description : The intensity change is gradual over a 
 few pixels . 
 • 
 Model : Represents real - world edges affected by 
 blurring or gradual transitions . 
 • Mathematical shape : A smooth transition ; often 
 modeled as a linear or sigmoid ramp . 
 The slope of the ramp is inversely 
 • Examples : Shadow boundaries or edges in out - of- proportional to the degree of blurring 
 in the edge . 
 focus regions 
 Edge detection : Introduction 
 Different edge models : Roof edges 
 • Description : Intensity increases to a peak and then 
 decreases symmetrically . 
 • 
 Model : Represents edges formed by narrow ridges or 
 lines . 
 • Mathematical shape : A peaked or triangular profile . 
 Edge detection : Introduction 
 • Direction of an adge refers to the way the entensity changes from one side of the edge to the other . 
 • Orientation describes the angle in which the edge is aligned . 
  Direction is about the change in intensity while orientation is about the alignment of that change .

 A variety of gradient operator has been proposed : 
 Good localization Poor localization 
 Noise sensitive Less noise sensitive 
 Poor detection Good detection 24

 Edge Detection using Gradients 
 Thresholding : Deciding which pixels definitely belong to an edge . 
 • Standard : Using a single threshold ( 𝑇 ) 
 ∇𝐼(𝑥 , 𝑦 ) < 𝑇 Definitely not an edge 
 ∇𝐼(𝑥 , 𝑦 ) ≥ 𝑇 Definitely an edge

 Hysteresis - based : 
 Edge Detection using Gradients 
 Thresholding : Deciding which pixels definitely belong to an edge . 
 • If the threshold is too high , important edges may be missed . 
 • If the threshold is too low , noise may be mistaken for a genuine edge .

 II . 
 Edge Detection using Laplacian 
  These sign changes usually occur at edges , especially where there is a sharp 
 change in intensity . 
  Laplacian does not provide the direction of edges . 
 Apply the Laplacian operator 
 • Convolve the image with a Laplacian kernel . 
 • This results in a new 2D image of Laplacian values : some positive , some negative . 
 Edge Detection : Derivatives and Noise 
 The noise introduces rapid 
 changes in the signal – and 
 𝒇 𝒙 
 the edge is also defined as a 
 rapid change in the signal 
 Noise leads to a false 
 𝛁𝒇 𝒙 
 interpretation of the edge . 
 ( Gradient ) 
 The edge is completely lost . 
 • The noise has to be removed / mitigated before applying 
 edge detection . 
  The solution : Image smoothing . 
 It is usually a mandatory 
 step prior to the use of derivatives .
