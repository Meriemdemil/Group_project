 Image Filtering in the Frequency Domain 
 • Today , we can say that there is no discipline of science or engineering that has not 
 been profoundly impacted by the Fourier transform . 
 • The goal of this lesson is to give a working knowledge of how the Fourier transform 
 and the frequency domain can be used for image filtering .

 Who is ? 
 He was actually obsessed with heat . 
 He was very interested in 
 knowing how heat propagated through materials of different 
 shapes . 
 = > That is what led him to develop the Fourier transform .

 Fourier Transform 
 • Basically , any periodic function can actually be written as a weighted 
 sum of infinite sinusoids of different frequencies . 
 • Functions that are not periodic ( but whose area under the curve is 
 finite ) can also be expressed as the integral of sines and cosines multiplied by a 
 weighting function

 Application to image filtering : 
 The low pass filter and the high pass filter 
 • Low frequencies in the transform are related to slowly varying intensity components . 
 • High frequencies are caused by sharp transitions in intensity , such as edges , corners 
 and noise 
  
 A filter H(u , v ) that attenuates high frequencies while passing low frequencies ( low- 
 pass filter ) blurs an image 
  A high - pass filter ( which attenuates low frequencies ) enhances sharp detail , but 
 cause a reduction in contrast in the image .

 In all of the previous examples , we have used only the magnitude . 
 Filtering has been performed considering only the magnitude . 
 What about the phase ? 
 In many cases , the phase is more important than the amplitude to 
 preserve the visual information . 
 Image Filtering in the Frequency Domain 
 In general , 
 • The amplitudes of the sinusoids determine the intensities in the image . 
 • The phase is a measure of displacement of the various sinusoids with respect to 
 their origin . 
 Carry much of the information about where discernable objects are located
