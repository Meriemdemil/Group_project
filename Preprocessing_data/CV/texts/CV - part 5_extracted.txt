 Correlation and convolution 
 Linear spatial filtering can be described in terms of correlation and convolution . 
 • Correlation : 
 The process of moving a filter mask over a signal ( the image in our case ) and computing 
 the sum of products at each location . 
 Correlation 
 An example : 
 Correlation vs. Convolution 
 • Correlation is a function of displacement of the filter . 
 Convolution works exactly the same way , but the filter is rotated by 180 ° before the 
 shift operations . 
 A fundamental property of convolution is that convolving a function with a unit 
 impulse yields a copy of the mask at the location of the impulse .

 Filters as Templates 
 • Filters offer a natural mechanism for finding simple patterns . 
 • Filters respond most strongly to pattern elements that look like the filter .

 Correlation as a Dot Product 
 When performing a correlation ( or a convolution ): 
 • The response is obtained by associating image elements with filter kernel elements , multiplying the 
 associated elements and summing 
 • It is the same process as a dot product . 
 • The dot product achieves its largest value when the vector representing the image is parallel to the 
 vector representing the kernel . 
  A filter responds most strongly when it encounters an image pattern that looks like the filter . 
  But this dot product is a poor way to find patterns because the response might be large just because 
 the image region is bright .

 Energy of the template Energy of the image area covered 
 by the template 
  This make the correlation insensitive to brightness .
