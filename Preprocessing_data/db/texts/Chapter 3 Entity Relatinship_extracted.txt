Objectives 
 The National Higher School of 
 Artificial Intelligence • 
 ER model forms the basis of an ER diagram • Refers to entity set and not to single entity occurrence 
 • 
 ERD represents conceptual database as viewed by end user • Corresponds to table and not to row in relational 
 • 
 ERDs depict database ’s main components : environment 
 – Entities • 
 In and Crow ’s Foot models , entity is represented by 
 – Attributes rectangle with entity ’s name 
 – Relationships 
 • 
 notation : attributes represented by ovals 
 connected to entity rectangle with a line 
 – Each oval contains the name of attribute it 
 represents 
 • 
 Required attribute : must have a value 
 Optional attribute : may be left empty 
 Domain : set of possible values for an attribute 
 – 
 Attributes may share a domain 
 • 
 Composite attribute can be subdivided 
 • Simple attribute can not be subdivided 
 • 
 Single - value attribute can have only a single 
 value 
 • 
 M : N relationships and multivalued attributes 
 should not be implemented 
 – Create several new attributes for each of the 
 original multivalued attributes ’ components 
 – Create new entity composed of original 
 multivalued attributes ’ components 
 • 
 Derived attribute : value may be calculated 
 from other attributes 
 Weak ( non - identifying ) relationships 
 – Exists if PK of related entity does not contain 
 PK component of parent entity 
 • 
 parent entity in relationship 
 Entity relationship ( ER ) model • 
 Connectivities and cardinalities are based on 
 – Uses ERD to represent conceptual database business rules 
 as viewed by end user • M : N relationship is valid at conceptual level 
 –
