Objectives 
 The National Higher School of 
 Designers , programmers , and end users see data in 
 need they fulfill different ways 
 • How data models can be classified by their level of • 
 Different views of same data lead to designs that do 
 not reflect organization ’s operation 
 abstraction 
 • 
 Data modeling reduces complexities of database 
 design 
 • 
 Data Modeling and Data Models 
 The Importance of Data Models 
 • 
 Data models • 
 Facilitate interaction among the designer , the 
 – Relatively simple representations of complex applications programmer , and the end user 
 real - world data structures 
 • End users have different views and needs for data 
 • Often graphical 
 • 
 Data model organizes data for various users 
 • 
 Model : an abstraction of a real - world object or event 
 • 
 Data model is an abstraction 
 – Useful in understanding complexities of the real - world 
 – Can not draw required data out of the data model 
 environment 
 • 
 Relationship : describes an association among entities 
 • 
 Description of operations to create / enforce actions within 
 – 
 Hierarchical and Network Models ( cont’d . ) 
 Conceptual organization of entire database as viewed by the 
 – Resembles hierarchical model 
 database administrator 
 • 
 Record may have more than one parent 
 – Subschema 
 Relational diagram 
 – Representation of entities , attributes , and 
 relationships 
 • 
 Each table is independent from another 
 • 
 Widely accepted standard for data modeling • 
 Entity instance ( or occurrence ) is row in table 
 • 
 Entity set is collection of like entities 
 • 
 Graphical representation of entities and their • 
 Connectivity labels types of relationships 
 relationships in a database structure • 
 Relationships are expressed using notation 
 • 
 Entity relationship diagram ( ERD ) – Relationships are represented by a diamond 
 – 
 Relationship name is written inside the diamond 
 – Uses graphic representations to model database 
 components • 
 Crow ’s Foot notation used as design standard in this 
 book 
 – 
 The Object - Oriented ( OO ) Model 
 • 
 Data and relationships are contained in a single structure 
 known as an object 
 • 
 OODM ( object - oriented data model ) is the basis for OODBMS 
 – Semantic data model 
 • 
 The Internet revolution created the potential to 
 – Semantic data model developed in response to exchange critical business information 
 increasing complexity of applications • 
 In this environment , Extensible Markup Language 
 – Includes many of OO model ’s best features ( XML ) emerged as the de facto standard 
 Often described as an object / relational database 
 • 
 Current databases support XML 
 management system ( O / RDBMS ) 
 – 
 Every key has a corresponding value or set of values 
 • 
 Sparse data 
 – Number of attributes is very large 
 – Number of actual data instances is low 
 • 
 Eventual consistency 
 – Updates will propagate through system ; eventually all data 
 copies will be consistent 
 Common characteristics : 
 – Conceptual simplicity with semantic completeness 
 – Represent the real world as closely as possible 
 – Real - world transformations must comply with 
 consistency and integrity characteristics 
 • 
 Each new data model capitalized on the 
 shortcomings of previous models 
 • 
 Some models better suited for some tasks 
 The External Model 
 Database designer starts with abstracted view , then • 
 End users ’ view of the data environment 
 adds details 
 • ER diagrams represent external views 
 • ANSI Standards Planning and Requirements 
 Conceptual 
 – Constraints 
 The Internal Model 
 • Provides a relatively easily understood macro level view • Representation of the database as “ seen ” by the DBMS 
 of data environment – Maps the conceptual model to the DBMS 
 • 
 Independent of both software and hardware • 
 Internal schema depicts a specific representation of an 
 internal model 
 – Does not depend on the DBMS software used to 
 implement the model • Depends on specific database software 
 – Does not depend on the hardware used in the – Change in DBMS software requires internal model be 
 implementation of the model changed 
 – Changes in hardware or software do not affect database • 
 Relational model aimed at logical level 
 – Does not require physical - level details 
 • 
 A data model is an abstraction of a complex real - world data 
 environment 
 • Basic data modeling components : 
 – Entities 
 – Attributes 
 – Relationships 
 – Constraints 
 • 
 Business rules identify and define basic modeling 
 components 
 Hierarchical model • 
 Object - oriented data model : object is basic modeling 
 OO data models depicted using UML
