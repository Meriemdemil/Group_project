Objectives 
 The National Higher School of 
 Artificial Intelligence 
 • In this chapter , you will learn : 
 only returns rows meeting criteria 
 Left outer join 
 • Also returns rows with unmatched attribute – Returns rows matching the join condition 
 values for tables to be joined – Returns rows in left side table with unmatched 
 Right outer join 
 – Full 
 – Returns rows matching join condition 
 • 
 Often necessary to process data based on 
 • 
 Most common type uses inner SELECT 
 other processed data 
 subquery on right side of WHERE comparison 
 • 
 Value generated by subquery must be of 
 – 
 Output of inner query is used as input for outer 
 query 
 • 
 All SQL - standard DBMSs support date and time 
 many data manipulations 
 functions 
 • SQL functions are similar to functions in 
 • 
 Functions always use numerical , date , or string 
 • 
 Date / time data types are implemented 
 value 
 differently by different DBMS vendors 
 • 
 Value may be part of a command or attribute in 
 • 
 ANSI SQL standard defines date data types , 
 a table 
 but not how data types are stored 
 Numeric Functions 
 • 
 Syntax : query MINUS query 
 – Example : 
 SELECT CUS_LNAME , CUS_FNAME , 
 CUS_INITIAL , CUS_AREACODE , FROM 
 Creating a View 
 • IN and NOT IN subqueries can be used in place • View 
 of INTERSECT – Virtual table based on a SELECT query 
 Oracle Sequences 
 • Batch update routine pools multiple • 
 MS Access AutoNumber data type fills a column 
 transactions into a single batch with unique numeric values 
 – Update master table field in a single operation • Oracle sequences 
 • Updatable view is a view that can be used to – Independent object in the database 
 update attributes in the base tables – Named , used anywhere a value expected 
 • 
 Not all views are updatable – Not tied to a table or column 
 – GROUP BY expressions or aggregate functions – Generate numeric values that can be assigned 
 can not be used to any column in any table 
 – Can not use set operators – Created and deleted at any time 
 – 
 Most restrictions are based on use of 
 Isolate critical code 
 – All applications access shared code 
 – Better maintenance and logic control 
 Procedural SQL ( cont’d . ) 
 • 
 Procedural SQL ( PL / SQL ) enables you to : 
 – Store procedural code and SQL statements in 
 database 
 – Merge SQL and traditional programming 
 constructs 
 • 
 Procedural SQL code automatically invoked by 
 • Named collection of procedural and SQL 
 RDBMS on data manipulation event 
 statements 
 • Trigger definition : 
 • Advantages 
 – Triggering timing : BEFORE or AFTER 
 – Substantially reduce network traffic and increase 
 – Triggering event : INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE performance 
 – Triggering level : • No transmission of individual SQL statements 
 over network 
 • 
 Statement - level trigger 
 – Reduce code duplication by means of code 
 • 
 Row - level trigger 
 isolation and code sharing 
 – Triggering action 
 • Minimize chance of errors and cost of application 
 • 
 Cursor : special construct in procedural SQL to • Named group of procedural and SQL 
 hold data rows returned by SQL query statements that returns a value 
 • 
 Explicit cursor : holds the output of an SQL IN data - type , … ) RETURN data - type [ IS ] 
 Key differences between SQL and procedural • 
 Embedded SQL framework defines : 
 languages : – Standard syntax to identify embedded SQL code 
 – Run - time mismatch within host language 
 • 
 • Operations that join tables are classified as 
 Summary ( cont’d . ) 
 • 
 When SQL statements return more than one 
 queries to generate new relation value inside the PL / SQL code , cursor is needed 
 • Oracle sequences may be used to generate • Embedded SQL uses SQL statements within an 
 values to be assigned to a record application programming language
