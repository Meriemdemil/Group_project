 Introduction to SQL 
 • 
 American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) 
 prescribes a standard SQL 
 • 
 – DBMS verifies that only registered users are – Group of database objects that are related to 
 able to access database each other 
 – Log on to RDBMS using user ID and password • CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION { creator } ; 
 created by database administrator 
 Primary key attributes contain both a NOT • NOT NULL constraint 
 NULL and a UNIQUE specification – Ensures that column does not accept nulls 
 • 
 RDBMS will automatically enforce referential • UNIQUE constraint 
 integrity for foreign keys 
 – Ensures that all values in column are unique 
 • 
 Command sequence ends with semicolon 
 • 
 DEFAULT constraint 
 – Assigns value to attribute when a new row is 
 added to table 
 Logical Operators : AND , OR , and NOT Special Operators 
 • 
 Searching data involves multiple conditions • 
 BETWEEN : checks whether attribute value is 
 within a range 
 • 
 Logical operators : AND , OR , and NOT 
 • IS NULL : checks whether attribute value is null 
 • Can be combined 
 – Parentheses enforce precedence order • LIKE : checks whether attribute value matches 
 given string pattern 
 • 
 Conditions in parentheses are always executed 
 first • 
 IN : checks whether attribute value matches any 
 • 
 All changes in table structure are made by • 
 ALTER can be used to change data type 
 using ALTER command 
 • 
 Some RDBMSs do not permit changes to data 
 • 
 SQL permits copying contents of selected table 
 existing rows columns 
 • 
 If relationship between entries and existing – Data need not be reentered manually into newly 
 columns , can assign values to slots created table(s ) 
 ALTER TABLE tablename ADD PRIMARY any relationship 
 KEY(fieldname ) ; 
 – Otherwise , RDBMS generates an error message 
 – For foreign key , use FOREIGN KEY in place of 
 – 
 Foreign key integrity violation 
 Access places nulls at the top of the list 
 – Compare to each value returned by the query 
 – Oracle places it at the bottom 
 • 
 SUM computes total sum for any specified 
 – Placement of nulls does not affect list contents 
 Alias identifies the source table from which data 
 between relational database and other DBs are taken 
 • 
 Join is performed when data are retrieved from • 
 Any legal table name can be used as alias 
 – Equality comparison between foreign key and 
 • 
 Add alias after table name in FROM clause 
 primary key of related tables 
 – FROM tablename alias 
 • 
 Join tables by listing tables in FROM clause of 
 SELECT statement 
 • Alias is especially useful when a table must be • 
 Summary ( cont’d . ) 
 • 
 DML commands allow you to add , modify , and • WHERE clause can be used with SELECT , 
 delete rows from tables UPDATE , and DELETE statements 
 The basic DML commands : • Aggregate functions 
 – SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE , – Special functions that perform arithmetic 
 COMMIT , and ROLLBACK computations over a set of rows 
 • SELECT statement is main data retrieval • 
 ORDER BY clause 
 command in SQL – Used to sort output of SELECT statement
