 The National Higher School of 
 Table 
 database model 
 – Structural and data independence 
 • Why indexing is important – Resembles a file conceptually 
 • 
 Logical view of relational database is based on 
 Relation thought of as a table 
 • 
 Each row in a table must be uniquely 
 identifiable 
 • 
 Key ’s role is based on determination 
 • 
 If you know the value of attribute A , you can 
 determine the value of attribute B 
 – Functional dependence 
 • 
 Composite key 
 – Composed of more than one attribute 
 • 
 Key attribute 
 – Any attribute that is part of a key 
 • Superkey 
 – Any key that uniquely identifies each row 
 • 
 Types of Keys ( cont’d . ) 
 • 
 Entity integrity – Can represent : 
 – Each row ( entity instance ) in the table has its • An unknown attribute value 
 own unique identity • 
 A known , but missing , attribute value 
 Inner join 
 – Links tables by selecting rows with common – Only returns matched records from the tables 
 values in common attributes ( join columns ) that are being joined 
 • 
 Equijoin • 
 Outer join 
 – Links tables on the basis of an equality condition – Matched pairs are retained , and any unmatched 
 that compares specified columns values in other table are left null 
 • 
 Left outer join 
 – Yields all of the rows in the CUSTOMER table 
 – Including those that do not have a matching 
 value in the AGENT table 
 • 
 Data redundancy leads to data anomalies 
 – Can destroy the effectiveness of the database 
 • 
 Index key 
 – Index ’s reference point 
 – Points to data location identified by the key 
 • 
 Products marketed as “ relational ” that did not 
 meet minimum relational standards 
 • 
 Each table row must have a primary key that 
 • Tables are basic building blocks of a relational 
 uniquely identifies all attributes 
 database 
 • 
 Keys are central to the use of relational tables • 
 Tables are linked by common attributes 
 • 
 Keys define functional dependencies • 
 The relational model supports relational algebra
