 Artificial Intelligence ● 
 For most business database design purposes , 3NF is as high as needed in 
 ○ normalization 
 Series of stages called normal forms : 
 ○ 
 Highest level of normalization is not always most desirable 
 ■ 
 Each project has its own project number , name , assigned 
 employees , etc . 
 ○ 
 Each employee has an employee number , name , job class 
 ○ 
 Charges its clients by billing hours spent on each contract 
 ○ 
 Table structure appears to work ; report is generated with ease 
 ● 
 Report may yield different results depending on what data anomaly 
 has occurred 
 ○ 
 Employee can be assigned to more than one project but each project includes only a 
 single occurrence of any one employee 
 ● 
 PROJECT_NUM , either a PK or part of a PK , contains NULLS 
 ● JOB_CLASS values could be abbreviated differently ● 
 No data item will be unnecessarily stored in more than one table 
 ● 
 Each time an employee is assigned to a project , all employee information is 
 ● 
 All nonprime attributes in a table are dependent on the primary key 
 duplicated 
 ● 
 Insertion anomalies – to insert a new employee who has not been 
 assigned to a project requires a phantom project 
 Deletion anomalies – 
 ● 
 Higher forms are not likely to be encountered in business environment 
 ● 
 Conversion to 2NF occurs only when the 1NF has a composite key 
 If the 1NF key is a single attribute , then the table is automatically in 2NF 
 ○ 
 The dependencies for the original key components are found by 
 ○ For each component of the PK that acts as a determinant in a partial dependency , 
 ○ The attributes in a partial dependency are removed from the 
 create a new table with a copy of that component as the PK 
 original table and placed in the new table with the dependency ’s 
 ○ 
 These components also remain in the original table in order to serve as FKs to the 
 determinant 
 original table 
 ○ 
 Any attributes that are not dependent in a partial dependency 
 ○ 
 Write each key component on a separate line ; then write the original composite 
 remain in the original table 
 key on the last line . 
 Evaluate Using Derived Attributes 
 The company manages many projects • PROJECT is in 3NF and needs no modification 
 • EMPLOYEE contains a transitive dependency so we now have 
 PROJECT(PROJ_NUM , PROJ_NAME ) 
 ○ 
 Each project requires the services of many employees EMPLOYEE(EMP_NUM , EMP_LNAME , EMP_FNAME , EMP_INITIAL , JOB_CODE ) 
 JOB(JOB_CODE , JOB_DESCRIPTION , JOB_CHG_HOUR ) 
 ○ An employee may be assigned to several projects 
 ○ Some employees are not assigned to a project and 
 perform non - project related duties . 
 As this M : N can not be implemented , we include the ASSIGNMENT • 
 ASSIGN_HOURS is assigned to ASSIGNMENT 
 entity to track the assignment of employees in projects 
 • 
 A “ manages ” relationship is added to in order to keep detailed 
 information about each project ’s manager 
 •
