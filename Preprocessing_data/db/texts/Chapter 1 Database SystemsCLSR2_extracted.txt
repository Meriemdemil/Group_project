 Course Description : A ) Course Test ( 30 mn ) – 10 % 
 The object of this course is to teach students the general concepts of relational databases and how to design a database that is 
 anomaly free . 
 Students will learn to design , create , populate , and query a database by working with a relational database engine and 
 the SQL language . 
 Students will also learn basic database administration skills such as creating users , granting / revoking privileges 
 individually or collectively to several users through the use of roles . 
 Further , students will learn how to create constraints with triggers B ) Tutorial Test ( 60 mn ) – 15 % 
 in addition to the use of PL / SQL language .

 Good decisions require good information derived • 
 Databases solve many of the problems encountered in 
 from raw facts data management

 Data : building blocks of information

 Raw data must be formatted for storage , processing , 
 • Good decision making is the key to organizational survival 
 and presentation

 Data management : focuses on proper generation ,

 Introducing the Database Role and Advantages of the DBMS 
 • 
 Database : shared , integrated computer structure that stores • 
 DBMS is the intermediary between the user and the 
 a collection of : 
 database 
 – End - user data : raw facts of interest to end user 
 – Metadata : data about data – 
 Database structure stored as file collection 
 • 
 Provides description of data characteristics and relationships in data 
 – Can only access files through the DBMS 
 • 
 Complements and expands value of data 
 Database management system ( DBMS ): collection of • 
 Databases can be classified according to : • Centralized database : data located at a single site 
 – Number of users 
 • 
 Distributed database : data distributed across several different 
 – 
 Database location(s ) 
 Expected type and extent of use 
 • 
 Operational database : supports a company ’s day - to - day 
 • 
 Multiuser database supports multiple users at the same – Transactional or production database 
 Types of Databases ( cont'd . ) 
 • 
 Security features difficult to program • 
 Unstructured data exist in their original state 
 – Often omitted in file system environments • 
 Structured data result from formatting 
 – 
 Structure applied based on type of processing to be 
 • 
 Summary of file system limitations : 
 performed 
 – Requires extensive programming 
 • 
 Semistructured data have been processed to some 
 – Can not perform ad hoc queries 
 extent 
 – System administration is complex and difficult 
 • 
 Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) represents data 
 – 
 Difficult to make changes to existing structures 
 elements in textual format 
 – Security features are likely to be inadequate 
 – XML database supports semistructured XML data 
 • Database design focuses on design of database structure used for 
 end - user data 
 – Designer must identify database ’s expected use 
 • 
 Well - designed database 
 – Facilitates data management 
 – Generates accurate and valuable information 
 Vendor offers single - user / personal DBMS version 
 • 
 Contents of each file folder are logically related 
 Manual file systems 
 – Complexity of database design is easier to understand 
 – Served as a data repository for small data collections 
 – Understanding file system problems helps to avoid problems with DBMS 
 – 
 Cumbersome for large collections 
 systems 
 • 
 Computerized file systems 
 – Knowledge of file system is useful for converting file system to database 
 – 
 Data processing ( DP ) specialist converted computer file structure from 
 system 
 manual system 
 • 
 File systems typically composed of collection of file folders , each tagged • Wrote software that managed the data 
 • 
 Designed the application programs 
 and kept in cabinet 
 – 
 Initially , computer file systems resembled manual systems 
 • 
 As number of files increased , file systems evolved 
 • 
 Each file used its own application program to store , 
 retrieve , and modify data 
 • 
 Structural dependence : access to a file is dependent on its • 
 Practical significance of data dependence is difference between 
 own structure 
 logical and physical format 
 All file system programs must be modified to conform to a new 
 • 
 Logical data format : how human views the data 
 file structure 
 • 
 Structural independence : change file structure without • 
 Physical data format : how computer must work with data 
 affecting data access 
 • 
 Each program must contain 
 • 
 Data dependence : data access changes when data storage 
 – Lines specifying opening of specific file type 
 characteristics change 
 – Record specification 
 • 
 Data independence : data storage characteristics do not 
 affect data access – Field definitions 
 File system structure makes it difficult to combine data from multiple • 
 Data inconsistency : different and conflicting versions of same data occur at 
 sources 
 different places 
 – Vulnerable to security breaches 
 • 
 Data anomalies : abnormalities when all changes in redundant data are not 
 • 
 Organizational structure promotes storage of same data in different 
 made correctly 
 locations 
 – Update anomalies : An agent has a new phone number , it must be changed in all 
 – Islands of information 
 records of that agent 
 Data stored in different locations is unlikely to be updated 
 consistently – 
 Insertion anomalies : A new agent would have to be entered with a dummy 
 • 
 Data redundancy : same data stored unnecessarily in different customer 
 places 
 – 
 Most users lack the skill to properly design databases • 
 Database system consists of logically related data stored in a 
 – Despite multiple personal productivity tools being single logical data repository 
 available 
 – May be physically distributed among multiple storage facilities 
 • 
 Data - modeling skills 
 – DBMS eliminates most of file system ’s problems 
 – 
 Vital in the data design process 
 – Current generation stores data structures , relationships between 
 • 
 Good data modeling facilitates communication 
 structures , and access paths 
 between the designer , user , and the developer 
 • 
 People : all users of the database system • 
 Database systems are created and managed at 
 – System and database administrators different levels of complexity 
 – 
 Database designers • 
 Database solutions must be cost - effective as well 
 – 
 Systems analysts and programmers as tactically and strategically effective 
 – End users 
 • Database technology already in use affects 
 Most functions are transparent to end users 
 – Can only be achieved through the DBMS 
 • Data dictionary management 
 – DBMS stores definitions of data elements and relationships ( metadata ) in a 
 data dictionary 
 – DBMS looks up required data component structures and relationships 
 – Changes automatically recorded in the dictionary 
 – 
 DBMS Functions ( cont'd . ) 
 • 
 Data transformation and presentation • 
 Multi - User access control 
 – DBMS transforms data entered to conform to required data structures – DBMS uses sophisticated algorithms to ensure concurrent access 
 – DBMS transforms physically retrieved data to conform to user ’s logical does not affect integrity 
 expectations 
 • 
 Backup and recovery management 
 • 
 Security management 
 – DBMS provides backup and data recovery to ensure data safety and 
 – DBMS creates a security system that enforces user security and data 
 integrity 
 privacy 
 – Recovery management deals with recovery of database after a failure 
 – Security rules determine which users can access the database , which 
 • Critical to preserving database ’s integrity 
 items can be accessed , etc . 
 Data integrity management • Database access languages and application 
 Managing the Database System : A Shift in Focus 
 • 
 Database communication interfaces • 
 Database system provides a framework in which strict 
 – Current DBMSs accept end - user requests via multiple procedures and standards enforced 
 different network environments 
 – 
 Role of human changes from programming to managing 
 – 
 Communications accomplished in several ways : 
 organization ’s resources 
 • 
 End users generate answers to queries by filling in screen 
 forms through Web browser • 
 Database system enables more sophisticated use of the data 
 • 
 DBMS automatically publishes predefined reports on a Web 
 • 
 Data structures created within the database and their 
 site 
 relationships determine effectiveness 
 • 
 Data are raw facts • 
 Metadata is data about data

 Information is the result of processing data to reveal its • 
 Database design defines the database structure
