 Why cluster evaluation ? 
 e To avoid Detecting clusters in random Structure 

 o Uncovering whether non - random structure exists in the data . 
 e 
 To evaluate Clustering Results 

 o Assessing how well the clustering aligns with the data without external reference . 
 e To compare with external known patterns 

 o 
 Comparing clustering results to externally known information , e.g. , class labels . 
 e To compare different Clusterings and algorithms 

 o 
 Evaluating and comparing different sets of clusters for quality . 
 “ The validation of clustering structures is the most 
 difficult and frustrating part of cluster analysis . 
 Without a strong effort in this direction , cluster analysis 
 will remain a black art accessible only to those true 
 believers who have experience and great courage . 
 Algorithms for Clustering Data , Jain and Dubes 

 Types of cluster evaluation measures 

 e 
 Unsupervised ( Internal ): measure the goodness of a clustering structure 
 without respect to external information . 
 The ground truth is not available . 
 o Examples : Cohesion , separation , SSE , Silhouette Coefficient . 
 e Supervised ( External ) : measure the extent to which cluster labels match 

 externally supplied class labels . 
 The ground truth is available . 
 o Examples : Entropy , Precision , Recall , F - measure .

 Cohesion vs Separation 

 Cluster cohesion ( Compactness ) 

 e 
 Measure how closely related object in a 
 cluster . 
 Cluster Separation 
 Measure how distinct or well- separated 
 a cluster is from other clusters . 
 Graph - Based View 

 Weighted graph where the weights are the distances 
 between data points . 

 Cohesion : Sum of proximities in a cluster . 
 e Cohesion : Sum of proximities to the cluster centroid . 
 cohesion(C ;) = > , proximity(x , c ;) 
 e Separation : Sum of proximites between centroids . 
 Between a cluster centroid and the global centroid 

 separation(C ;) = proximity(ci , c ) 


 Prototype - Based View 

 Represent a clusters using their centroids . 

 Cohesion : Sum of proximities to the cluster centroid . 

 cohesion(C ;) = > , proximity(x , c ;) 

 o 
 Between a cluster centroid and the global centroid 

 separation(Ci ;) = proximity(ci , c ) 

 Silhouette Coefficient 

 Silhouette coefficient combines cohesion and 

 separation . 

 Lo , as a = av 
 For an individual point / 9 
 Oo a = average distance of / to the points in its cluster an 

 o b = min ( average distance of / to points in another cluster ) C.

 LJ Precision , Recall , F - measure 

 Entropy 
 Entropy measures the extent to which the clustering structure 
 matches external class labels . 
 e Pure cluster is cluster that contain only one class label . 
 e We measure the purity of a cluster using the entropy . 
 e How to Use Entropy for Evaluation : 
 o Calculate entropy for each cluster . 
 o Sum the entropies to get an overall measure . 
 Lower values indicate better alignment with external class labels .

 Precision , Recall , F - measure 

 e Precision : The fraction of a cluster / that consists of objects of a specified class . 
 Recall : The extent to which a cluster contains all objects of a specified class .
