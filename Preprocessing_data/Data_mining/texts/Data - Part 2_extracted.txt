 Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA ) 

 LJ EDA is a set of statistical and visualization techniques . 
 L ) _ Used for seeing what the data can tell us before the preprocessing and modeling : 
 _ ) Understand the data and summarize its keys properties . 

 Discover noisy data and outliers . 
 Comprehend the distribution of the data . 
 The method is either univariate or multivariate ( Usually just bivariate ) .

 Asample is an unbiased subset that best 

 represents the entire population . 
 Measuring the Central Tendency : ( 1 ) Mean

 OQ 
 Trimmed mean : Chopping extreme values ( e.g. , olympics gymnastics score computation ) 
 Median is the middle value in a data set when values are ordered . 
 How to calculate 

 Q 
 Sort data in ascending order . 
 Repeat values according to their frequency . 
 Ifthere 's an odd number of data points , the median is the middle value . 
 Useful for skewed distributions . 
 Median is in the position ceil(13/2 ) = 7 
 OQ 
 The median bin is the value 10 - 20 

 How to find the median value ? 


 Median calculation for grouped data 

 : : ( n/2)—B 
 Estimated Median = L + — ~ — 
 L : the lower class boundary of the median bin . 

 n : the total number of values . 

 B : cumulative frequency of the bins before the median 
 bin . 

 G : the frequency of the median bin . 
 Measuring the Central Tendency : ( 3 ) Mode 

 QO Mode : Value that occurs most frequently in the data 

 Q Unimodal 
 Q 
 QO Positive Covariance : both variables move together . 
 O Negative Covariance : variables move in opposite directions . 
 QO Zero Covariance : bo clear pattern in variable movements . 
 Understanding relationships between variables . 
 Covariance is useful but sensitive to scale , while correlation 
 addresses this issue by standardizing the measurement .

 n is the number of tuples , , and p , are the respective means of X , and X , , 

 oO , and O , are the respective standard deviation of X , and X , 
 If p , , > 0 : A and B are positively correlated ( X , ’s values increase as X , ’s ) 
 If p , , = 0 : independent ( under the same assumption as discussed in co - variance ) 
 If p , , < 0 : negatively correlated
